##Publicity Officer: Vicki Chow

    <div class="medium-9 columns" markdown="1">
Vicki is currently a first year undergraduate student in the Faculty of Arts at UBC and is thrilled to be a part of the executive team. Even though her first instrument is technically the piano, once she started playing the alto saxophone, there was no going back. She has played in her secondary school's jazz band, which included a performance "for the Premier" (Said Premier was absent during the actual performance). Other than the Thunderbird Marching Band, she is a member of the Speech and Linguistics Student Association and a junior student in the Arts Tri-Mentoring Program.
